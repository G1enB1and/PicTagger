Creating a Symlink in Windows
Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

Create a symbolic link:

mklink /D C:\Pictures\Gallery\External C:\Pictures

This command creates a directory symlink named External in C:\Pictures\Gallery that points to C:\Pictures.

Access files in C:\Pictures via C:\Pictures\Gallery\External in your server:
